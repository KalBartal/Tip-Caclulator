# Tip Calculator

This is my coding challenge submission for day #2 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

This simple application takes 3 inputs; bill amount, desired tip amount in percentage and how many people are there to split the bill between.

On recieving these 3 inputs, the application divides the bill by the number of people and tells the user how much each person should pay. 

## Usage

```
Welcome to the tip calculator!

What was the total bill?
How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15(%)?
How many people to split the bill?

Each person should pay: ${amount}.
```
